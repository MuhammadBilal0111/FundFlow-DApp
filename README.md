## Getting Started
Ensure you have the necessary environment variables in place before running the project.

### Prerequisites
- MetaMask Wallet
- Ethereum Test Network (e.g., Sepolia)

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file and add the following credentials:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/
```

Additionally, ensure that the Sentry authentication token is stored in the `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file:

```env
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=
```
---
## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadBilal0111/fundflow.git
cd fundflow
npm install
```

## Running the Project

Run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Smart Contract Deployment

FundFlow uses smart contracts written in Solidity. You can deploy these contracts using Hardhat.

Compile and deploy your smart contract to the Ethereum network (e.g., Sepolia):

```
cd contract
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```
### Deploy Smart Contract to Sepolia Testnet

#### Configure Network (Etherscan, MetaMask, Alchemy API Keys)

Modify `hardhat.config.js` to include:

```js
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.28",
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      sepolia: <ETHERSCAN_API_KEY>,
    },
  },
  networks: {
    sepolia: {
      url: `https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/${<ALCHEMY_API_KEY>}`,
      accounts: <SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY>,
    },
};
```
